Hangout-isOnline
================

The new Google Hangouts doesn't allow anymore to view if a buddy is online or offline.

With the old Gtalk connection it's still possible to know if someone is online and with app he's using with this combinations:
-Gtalk online/away
-Hangouts from PC online/away
-Hangouts from mobile

*Unfortunally at the moment it's impossible to know if someone is online or offline from mobile*

If someone has a solution for that any contribution is helpfull!
